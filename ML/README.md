Learning Python:
For learning basics of python in detail, I used book followed in CBSE syllabus for computer science - 
1) Computer Science with python by Sumita Arora class 11
Chapters: 6,7,8,9,11,12,13
2) Computer Science with python by Sumita Arora class 12
Chapters: 3,5

Mastering basic data science libraries:
In order to enter into the world of ML, one needs to first learn a few python libraries. After a lot of research, i would say a one stop destination to learn numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries which are essential for data science and ML are-
1) Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas
Chapters: 2,3 in detail and initial part of ch 4
https://tanthiamhuat.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/pythondatasciencehandbook.pdf
2) Introduction to data science with python coursera (University of Michigan)
https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis

Andrew NGâ€™s stanford machine learning course to study in depth mathematics in machine learning. Go for as many guided projects as possible from coursera, pick up any random course for specific topic from udemy or go for complete ml track from Coding ninjas. After you are confident enough, start doing projects from kaggle. Random datasets can be found on kaggle,anazon datasets, UcI ml depository, etc.

I started learning machine learning from coursera Introduction to machine learning course by andrew ng. Then udemy AtoZ Machine learning course. After this one can do project oriented courses or individual/team ML projects. Kaggle is best place to start.
