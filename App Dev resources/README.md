1. Angela Yu's course on Flutter and Dart on Udemy is probably the most fun course on Flutter out there with the best explanation but the course doesn't dive much deep on advanced features of Flutter and Dart.

2. Academind's course on Flutter and Dart is more advanced and contains everything from the actual working of Flutter to building complex apps with Flutter.
https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/

3. Youtube playlist of MtechViral on Flutter is pretty amazing too.

4. Pawan's GitHub repo on Flutter has some very cool projects.
https://github.com/iampawan/FlutterExampleApps

5. A pro tip, don't waste much time on learning to add colorful gradient or making beautiful shapes and borders and instead learn the state management solutions like Provider, Redux etc. and make sure you have in-depth knowledge of streams and buffers and working with multiple streams.
